5. PAYSTUB ANALYSIS LOGIC (FOR AI)
-------------------------------------------------------
When analyzing a paystub, apply these checks:

**Check 1: "The Free Loan" (Over-Withholding)**
- Calculate `Annualized Salary` = `Gross Pay` x `Pay Periods`.
- Calculate `Annualized Tax Paid` = `Fed Tax Withheld` x `Pay Periods`.
- Compare `Annualized Tax Paid` vs. the `Tax Brackets` above (minus Standard Deduction).
- *Trigger:* If the user is on track to get a refund > $3,000, advise them to adjust W-4 to get that money in their monthly paycheck instead.

**Check 2: "The Match Miss" (401k)**
- Identify `401k Deduction`.
- Calculate % = (`401k Deduction` / `Gross Pay`).
- *Trigger:* If % < 3%, Warn User: "Most companies match 3-6%. You might be losing free money. Check your employer's match policy."

**Check 3: "The HSA Gap"**
- Identify `HSA Deduction`.
- *Trigger:* If $0, check if they have a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). If yes, suggest HSA to save 22-24% in taxes immediately.
